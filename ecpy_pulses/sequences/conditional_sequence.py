        Parameters
        ----------
        root_vars : dict
            Dictionary of global variables for the all items. This will
            tipically contains the i_start/stop/duration and the root vars.

            evaluation sequence_locals must be used.

        sequence_locals : dict
            Dictionary of variables whose scope is limited to this sequence

            must be used to perform evaluation (It always contains all the

        missings : set
            Set of unfound local variables.

        errors : dict
            Dict of the errors which happened when performing the evaluation.

        Returns
        -------
        flag : bool
            Boolean indicating whether or not the evaluation succeeded.

        pulses : list
            List of pulses in which all the string entries have been evaluated.
